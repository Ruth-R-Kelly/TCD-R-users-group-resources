# R Club Trinity College Dublin

DIY automated data visualisation

## Description

There are four files:

1. rclub.R The tutorial 

2. rclub.RData The data and functions that we will use in the tutorial. The modelled data has been removed as it's unpublished, but all objects are stored in the workspace and a sample data set is provided 

3. smith_rclub.pdf The plot gallery and explanation of why you would want to hand code your plotting functions

4. plant_invader_plot.pdf This is what the plant invader model plot should look like. The code was written on mac and might not look pretty on R Studio or another platform. 

## Authors

All code and functions in rclub.R and rclub.RData written by Annabel Smith, unless otherwise indicated.
